According to the selected paper, category these papers with the types of experiments they conduct and write a related work report to summarize the commonly conducted experiments in this research area.

User intention
The user wants to categorize papers based on the types of experiments they conduct and create a related work report summarizing commonly conducted experiments in the research area. This involves identifying the experiments associated with each paper and analyzing the frequency or commonality of these experiments.
Execute Plan
Identify the 'Paper' nodes that are connected to 'Dimension_Experiment' nodes via the 'Paper_Has_Experiment' relationship.; Extract the 'name' and 'settings' properties from the 'Dimension_Experiment' nodes to understand the types of experiments conducted.; Categorize the papers based on the experiment types.; Count the occurrences of each experiment type across all papers.; Summarize the findings in a related work report, highlighting the most commonly conducted experiments.
Required data
