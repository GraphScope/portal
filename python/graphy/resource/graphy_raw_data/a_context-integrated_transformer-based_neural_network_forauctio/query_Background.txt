**SECTION_1**: 1 Introduction Auction design is a classical problem in computational economics, with many applications on sponsored search Jansen and Mullen, 2008 , resource allocation Huang et al., 2008 and blockchain Galal and Youssef, 2018 . Designing an incentive compatible mechanism that maximizes the auctioneer s expected revenue is one of the central topics in auction design. The seminal work by Myerson 1981 pro

In addition, machine learning has also been applied to nd approximate solutions for multiple items settings Balcan et al., 2008, Lahaie, 2011, D utting et al., 2015 , and there are also many works analyzing the sample complexity of designing optimal auctions Cole and Roughgarden, 2014, Devanur et al., 2016, Balcan et al., 2016, Guo et al., 2019, Gonczarowski and
**SECTION_1**: As discussed before, it is an intricate task to design optimal auctions for multiple bidders and multiple items. Many previous works focus on special cases to name a few, Manelli and Vincent 2006 , Pavlov 2011 , Giannakopoulos and Koutsoupias 2014 , Yao 2017 , Daskalakis et al. 2017 , Haghpanah and Hartline 2021 and the algorithmic characterization of optimal auction e.g., Chawla et al. 2010 , Cai et al. 2012 , Babaio et al. 2014 , Yao 2014 , Cai and
**SECTION_1**: We formulate the contextual auction design as a learning problem and extend the learning framework 1 arXiv:2201.12489v3 cs.GT 22 Jan 2023
**SECTION_1**: 2019, Nedelec et al., 2021, Shen et al., 2020, Brero et al., 2021, Liu et al., 2021 . Typically, we can formulate auction design as a constrained optimization problem and nd near optimal solutions using standard machine learning pipelines. However, existing methods only consider simple settings: they either focus on a xed set of bidders and items, e.g. D utting et al., 2019, Rahme et al., 2021b or
**SECTION_1**: vides an optimal auction design for the single item setting; however, designing a revenue optimal auction is still not fully understood even for two bidders and two items setting after four decades D utting et al., 2019 . Recently, pioneered by D utting et al. 2019 , there is rapid progress on nding approximate optimal auction through deep learning, e.g., Shen et al., 2019, Luong et al., 2018, Tacchetti et al.,
**SECTION_1**: bidders and items. To handle such a practical problem, we need a new architecture that can incorporate public features and take a di erent number of bidders and items as inputs. Main Contributions In this paper, we consider contextual auction design, in which each bidder or item is equipped with context. In contextual auctions, the bidder contexts and item contexts can characterize various bidders and items to some extent, making the auctions close to those in practice.
**SECTION_1**: ignore the identity of bidders and items so that the auction is restricted to be symmetric Rahme et al. 2021a . As a comparison, in practice, auctions are much more complex beyond the aforementioned simple settings. For instance, in e commerce advertising, there are a large number of bidders and items i.e., ad slots with various features Liu et al. 2021 , and each auction involves a di erent number of
**SECTION_paper_meta**: One of the central problems in auction design is developing an incentive compatible mechanism that maximizes the auctioneer s expected revenue. While theoretical approaches have encountered bottlenecks in multi item auctions, recently, there has been much progress on nding the optimal mechanism through deep learning. However, these works either focus on a xed set of bidders and items, or restrict the auction to be symmetric. In this work, we overcome such limitations by fac
**SECTION_1**: item contexts to develop an auction mechanism. It is built upon the transformer architecture Vaswani et al. 2017 , which can capture the complex mutual in uence among di erent bidders and items in an auction. As a result, CITransNet is permutation equivariant Rahme et al., 2021a over bids and contexts, i.e., any permutation of bidders or items in the bidding pro le and bidder contexts or item
**SECTION_1**: Zhiyanov and Drutsa, 2020 , in which at every round the item is priced by the seller to sell to a strategic buyer, and second price auctions Golrezaei et al., 2021 . As a comparison, we consider the o ine setting of contextual sealed bid auction. We learn the mechanism from historical data and optimize the expected revenue for the auctioneer. Besides, we do not assume the conditional distribution of the bidder s valuation when given both the bidder context and item context. Organization
**SECTION_1**: contexts would cause the same permutation of auction result We will provide a formal de nition in Remark 3.1 . Moreover, in CITransNet, the number of parameters does not depend on the auction scale i.e., the number of bidders and items , which brings CITransNet the potential of generalizing to auctions with various bidders or items, which we denote as out of setting generalization. We show by extensive experiments that CITransNet can almost reach the same result as Myer
**SECTION_1**: architecture called EquivariantNet to design symmetric auctions, a special case that is anonymous bidder symmetric and item symmetric. In contrast, we study optimal contextual auction design, and our proposed CITransNet is permutation equivariant while not restricted to symmetric auctions. Existing literatures of contextual auction mainly discuss the online setting of some known contextual repeated auctions, e.g., posted price auctions Amin et al., 2014, Mao et al., 2018, Drutsa, 2020,
**SECTION_1**: proposed in D utting et al. 2019 to our setting. Furthermore, we present a sample complexity result to bound the generalization error of the learned mechanism. To overcome the aforementioned limitations of the previous works, we propose CITransNet: a Context Integrated Transformer based neural Network architecture as the parameterized mechanism to be optimized. CITransNet incorporates the bidding pro le along with the bidder contexts and
**SECTION_paper_meta**: toring public contextual information of bidders and items into the auction learning framework. We propose CITransNet, a context integrated transformer based neural network for optimal auction design, which maintains permutation equivariance over bids and contexts while being able to nd asymmetric solutions. We show by extensive experiments that CITransNet can recover the known optimal solutions in single item settings, outperform strong baselines in multi item auctions, and
**SECTION_1**: Golowich et al. 2018 modify RegretNet to handle di erent constraints and objectives. Curry et al. 2020 extend RegretNet to be able to verify strategyproofness of the auction mechanism learned by neural network. ALGNet Rahme et al. 2021b models the auction design problem as a two player game through parameterizing the misreporter as well. PreferenceNet Peri et al. 2021 encodes human preference e.g. fairness into RegretNet. Rahme et al. 2021a propose a permutation equivariant
**SECTION_1**: Weinberg, 2021 . In our paper, we follow the paradigm of automated mechanism design Conitzer and Sandholm, 2002, 2004, Sandholm and Likhodedov, 2015 . D utting et al. 2019 propose the rst neural network framework, RegretNet, to automatically design optimal auctions for general multiple bidders and multiple items settings by modeling an auction as a multi layer neural network and using standard machine learning pipelines.

**SECTION_1**: son 1981 in single item auctions and can obtain better performance in complex multi item auctions compared to those strong baseline algorithms we use. Additionally, we also justify its out of setting generalization ability. Experimental results demonstrate that, under the same contextual setting, CITransNet can still perform well in auctions with a di erent number of bidders or items than those in training.
