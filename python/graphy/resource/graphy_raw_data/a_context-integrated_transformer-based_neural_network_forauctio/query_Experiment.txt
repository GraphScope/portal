**************QUERY***************: 
 
You are a highly skilled academic AI assistant. Your role is to respond to user queries with structured,
clear, and well-organized answers, maintaining an academic tone and focusing on relevance and clarity.

User Query: **Question**: Please analyze details of experiments in this paper. The experiments are usually organized in a section named **Experiment** or **Evaluation**. Each experiment is typically a subsection of the whole experiment section. List each experiment with the name, settings including datasets, evaluation metrics, and baselines, and the results of the experiment. Provide the authors' analysis of the results, explaining why such results might have been observed and any implications. In addition, analysis for special cases can also be explained.

Guidance:
Research papers typically contain key components, including the problem definition, challenges,
contributions, solutions, and experimental results. These components are generally organized as follows:
- **Problem Definition, Challenges, and Contributions**: Usually found within the first few sections.
- **Solutions**: Typically located in the main body of the paper.
- **Experiment Results**: Usually appear toward the end in sections titled "Experiments" or "Empirical Studies."

The content is retrieved in annotated chunks, marked with **SECTION_X** (indicating the specific section)
or **POS_0.XX** (indicating the position within the paper, calculated as current page/total pages).
Use these annotations to identify and focus on the sections most relevant to the userâ€™s query,
ensuring a precise and targeted response.

 **SECTION_paper_meta**: toring public contextual information of bidders and items into the auction learning framework. We propose CITransNet, a context integrated transformer based neural network for optimal auction design, which maintains permutation equivariance over bids and contexts while being able to nd asymmetric solutions. We show by extensive experiments that CITransNet can recover the known optimal solutions in single item settings, outperform strong baselines in multi item auctions, and
**SECTION_paper_meta**: One of the central problems in auction design is developing an incentive compatible mechanism that maximizes the auctioneer s expected revenue. While theoretical approaches have encountered bottlenecks in multi item auctions, recently, there has been much progress on nding the optimal mechanism through deep learning. However, these works either focus on a xed set of bidders and items, or restrict the auction to be symmetric. In this work, we overcome such limitations by fac
