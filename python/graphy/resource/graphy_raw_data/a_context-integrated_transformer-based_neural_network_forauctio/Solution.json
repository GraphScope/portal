            "name": "CITransNet Design",
            "description": "The authors introduce CITransNet, a context-integrated transformer-based neural network designed to maintain permutation equivariance over bids and contexts, making it suitable for handling varying numbers of bidders and items. The architecture includes transformer layers, permutation equivariant modules, and context integration through attention mechanisms."

            "name": "Learning Framework Extension",
            "description": "The paper formulates contextual auction design as a learning problem and extends the learning framework to incorporate public contextual information of bidders and items. This includes data preprocessing, feature embedding, and the use of attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different contextual features."
        },
        {
            "name": "Sample Complexity Analysis",
            "description": "The authors provide a sample complexity result to bound the generalization error of the learned mechanism, ensuring that CITransNet can generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. The model also employs regularization techniques and extensive cross-validation to improve generalization."

            "name": "Experimental Validation",
            "description": "Extensive experiments demonstrate that CITransNet can recover known optimal solutions in single-item settings. The model is tested on benchmark datasets, and key performance metrics such as revenue, efficiency, and fairness are used to evaluate its performance."
