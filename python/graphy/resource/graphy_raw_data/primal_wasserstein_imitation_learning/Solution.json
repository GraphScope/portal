            "description": "PWIL is based on the primal form of the Wasserstein distance, which measures the dissimilarity between the state-action distributions of the expert and the agent. The reward function is derived from the negative Wasserstein distance, and the agent's policy is optimized using RL algorithms like PPO or TRPO."

            "name": "Reward Function Design",
            "description": "The reward function is derived offline without the need for continuous interaction with the environment. This is achieved by precomputing the Wasserstein distance between the expert and the agent's state-action distributions, reducing computational overhead and minimizing the need for fine-tuning."

            "name": "Sample Efficiency",
            "description": "The Wasserstein distance provides a more stable and informative signal for learning, which helps in reducing the number of required samples. The agent's policy is iteratively refined using a small set of expert demonstrations and the reward function derived from the Wasserstein distance."

        {
            "name": "Generalization Across Tasks",
            "description": "PWIL is designed to generalize across different continuous control tasks by focusing on behavioral similarity rather than just performance metrics. The agent is trained on a diverse set of tasks, and transfer learning techniques are used to adapt the learned policy to new tasks."

        {
            "name": "Behavioral Similarity vs. Performance",
            "description": "The paper validates that the behavior of the agent trained using PWIL closely matches the expert's behavior, as measured by the Wasserstein distance. The agent's policy is optimized to balance both behavioral similarity and performance, ensuring that the agent acts in a manner consistent with the expert while achieving high performance."
