You are a highly skilled academic AI assistant. Your role is to respond to user queries with structured,
clear, and well-organized answers, maintaining an academic tone and focusing on relevance and clarity.

User Query: **Contribution**:
RESPONSE: {'data': [{'original': 'we propose a novel agent model for one to many concurrent bilateral negotiations in open, dynamic and unknown e market settings.', 'summary': 'Novel agent model for concurrent negotiations.'}, {'original': 'we extend the existing simulation environment Alrayes et al., 2016 to generate data and perform experiments that support agent learning for negotiation.', 'summary': 'Extension of simulation environment for data generation and experiments.'}, {'original': 'we run an extensive experiments showing that our approach outperforms the existing strategies and produces adaptable agents that can transfer to a range of e market settings.', 'summary': 'Extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance and adaptability.'}]}

**Question**: Please summarize some challenges in this paper. Each challenge has a summarized NAME, detailed DESCRIPTION, and SOLUTION.

Guidance:
Research papers typically contain key components, including the problem definition, challenges,
contributions, solutions, and experimental results. These components are generally organized as follows:
- **Problem Definition, Challenges, and Contributions**: Usually found within the first few sections.
- **Solutions**: Typically located in the main body of the paper.
- **Experiment Results**: Usually appear toward the end in sections titled "Experiments" or "Empirical Studies."

The content is retrieved in annotated chunks, marked with **SECTION_X** (indicating the specific section)
or **POS_0.XX** (indicating the position within the paper, calculated as current page/total pages).
Use these annotations to identify and focus on the sections most relevant to the userâ€™s query,
ensuring a precise and targeted response.

 **SECTION_abstract**: negotiation. As a result, we can build automated agents for concurrent negotiations that can adapt to different e market settings without the need to be pre programmed. Our experimental evaluation shows that our deep reinforcement learning based agents outperform two existing well known negotiation strategies in one to many concurrent bilateral negotiations for a range of e market settings.
**SECTION_abstract**: Abstract We present a novel negotiation model that allows an agent to learn how to negotiate during concurrent bilateral negotiations in unknown and dynamic e markets. The agent uses an actor critic architecture with model free reinforcement learning to learn a strategy expressed as a deep neural network. We pre train the strategy by supervision from synthetic market data, thereby decreasing the exploration time required for learning during
