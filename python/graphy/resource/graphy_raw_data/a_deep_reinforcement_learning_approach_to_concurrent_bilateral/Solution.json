            "name": "Dynamic and Unknown E-Market Settings",
            "description": "The authors propose a novel agent model that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to adapt to changing market conditions. The agent employs an actor-critic architecture, which consists of an actor responsible for selecting actions based on the current state of the environment and a critic that evaluates the actions taken by the actor. The learning process involves state representation, action space, reward function, and model-free learning, enabling the agent to learn negotiation strategies through interaction with the environment."

            "name": "Concurrent Negotiations",
            "description": "The paper introduces a model that enables the agent to handle concurrent negotiations effectively. The agent's strategy is learned through extensive training in a simulated environment, which extends existing frameworks to simulate multiple concurrent negotiations. The agent is trained to balance multiple negotiations by aggregating state representation, coordinating actions, and shaping rewards to consider the cumulative outcomes of all negotiations."

            "description": "To reduce the initial exploration time, the authors pre-train the agent using synthetic market data. This supervised pre-training initializes the agent's policy, providing a good starting point for further learning. Transfer learning allows the pre-trained model to quickly adapt to real-world scenarios, improving the agent's performance from the outset."

            "name": "Adaptability to Different E-Market Settings",
            "description": "The authors conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that their DRL-based agents can transfer their learned skills to a range of e-market settings. The experiments are conducted in diverse environments with different rules and dynamics, and the performance is compared against existing well-known negotiation strategies. The model-free reinforcement learning approach allows the agent to adapt to new environments without requiring explicit programming, showing robustness and adaptability."
