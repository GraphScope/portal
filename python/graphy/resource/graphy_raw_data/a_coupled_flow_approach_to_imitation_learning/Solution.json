            "description": "The authors propose using normalizing flows to explicitly model the state distribution. Normalizing flows are a class of models that transform a simple probability distribution (e.g., Gaussian) into a more complex one through a series of invertible transformations. Components include normalizing flows and coupled flows, and the algorithm details involve coupling through the Donsker-Varadhan representation and training to minimize the KL divergence."

            "description": "A novel approach to density estimation using coupled normalizing flows, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) representation of the KL divergence. Components include the DV representation and coupled flows, with an objective function designed to minimize the KL divergence and an optimization process that maximizes the DV objective."

            "description": "Designed to achieve state-of-the-art performance even with limited data, such as a single expert trajectory. Components include handling a single expert trajectory and state-only regimes, with algorithm details focusing on data efficiency and performance evaluation in various settings."

Evaluation metrics include comparing the learned state distribution with the expert's state distribution using BC graphs."

            "description": "Encourages further research into explicit modeling of state-action distributions, extending the coupled normalizing flow approach to model both state and state-action distributions. Future work should focus on modeling the joint distribution of states and actions to improve generalization and performance in diverse environments."
