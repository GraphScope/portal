**************QUERY***************: 
 
You are a highly skilled academic AI assistant. Your role is to respond to user queries with structured,
clear, and well-organized answers, maintaining an academic tone and focusing on relevance and clarity.

User Query: **Question**: Please describe the problem studied in this paper, why the problem is worth studying, and what are the issues of existing solutions to this problem.

Guidance:
Research papers typically contain key components, including the problem definition, challenges,
contributions, solutions, and experimental results. These components are generally organized as follows:
- **Problem Definition, Challenges, and Contributions**: Usually found within the first few sections.
- **Solutions**: Typically located in the main body of the paper.
- **Experiment Results**: Usually appear toward the end in sections titled "Experiments" or "Empirical Studies."

The content is retrieved in annotated chunks, marked with **SECTION_X** (indicating the specific section)
or **POS_0.XX** (indicating the position within the paper, calculated as current page/total pages).
Use these annotations to identify and focus on the sections most relevant to the userâ€™s query,
ensuring a precise and targeted response.

 **SECTION_1**: generative probabilistic models have the ability to create novel content, they also have a wide range of reconstruction related applications including inpainting 61, 46, 59 , denoising 3 , colorization 71 , and super resolution 9 . As data of interest are generally high dimensional and highly structured, the challenge in this domain is building models that are powerful enough to capture its complexity yet still trainable. We address
**SECTION_1**: this challenge by introducing real valued non volume preserving real NVP transformations, a tractable yet expressive approach to modeling high dimensional data. This model can perform ef cient and exact inference, sampling and log density estimation of data points. Moreover, the architecture presented in this paper enables exact and ef cient reconstruction of input images from the hierarchical features extracted by this model.

**SECTION_1**: 1 Introduction The domain of representation learning has undergone tremendous advances due to improved supervised learning techniques. However, unsupervised learning has the potential to leverage large pools of unlabeled data, and extend these advances to modalities that are otherwise impractical or impossible. One principled approach to unsupervised learning is generative probabilistic modeling. Not only do

We demonstrate its ability to model natural images on four datasets through sampling, log likelihood evaluation, and latent variable
