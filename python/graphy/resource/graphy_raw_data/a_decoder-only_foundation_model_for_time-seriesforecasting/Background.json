        "problem_definition": "The paper focuses on the development of a time series foundation model for forecasting, specifically designed to operate effectively in a zero-shot setting. Time series forecasting is a critical task in various domains, including retail, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and natural sciences.",
        "problem_value": "1. **Ubiquity and Importance**: Time series data is ubiquitous across numerous industries and scientific fields. Accurate forecasting is essential for decision-making processes, such as supply chain optimization, energy and traffic prediction, and weather forecasting. 2. **Challenges in Current Solutions**: Existing methods, while effective in certain scenarios, often require extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and fine-tuning. Moreover, they may not generalize well to new, unseen datasets without additional training. 3. **Potential of Foundation Models**: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP), the authors explore whether a similar foundation model can be developed for time series forecasting. Such a model could potentially reduce the computational burden and improve zero-shot performance, making it more accessible and practical for a wide range of applications.",
        "existing_solutions": "1. **Data Requirements**: Unlike NLP, where vast amounts of text data are readily available, time series data is often domain-specific and less abundant. This makes it challenging to train large-scale models that can generalize well across different datasets. 2. **Model Complexity**: Deep learning models for time series forecasting can be computationally expensive and require significant resources for training and fine-tuning. This limits their accessibility and practicality, especially for small and medium-sized organizations. 3. **Generalization**: Existing models often struggle to generalize to new, unseen datasets without additional training. This limitation reduces their utility in dynamic environments where new data sources and forecasting tasks frequently emerge. 4. **Scalability**: Handling varying history lengths, prediction lengths, and time granularities is a significant challenge. Most models are designed for specific contexts and may not perform well when these parameters change."
