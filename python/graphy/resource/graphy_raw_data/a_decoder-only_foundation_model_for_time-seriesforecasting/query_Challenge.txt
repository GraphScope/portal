**Question**: Please summarize some challenges in this paper. Each challenge has a summarized NAME, detailed DESCRIPTION, and SOLUTION.

Guidance:
Research papers typically contain key components, including the problem definition, challenges,
contributions, solutions, and experimental results. These components are generally organized as follows:
- **Problem Definition, Challenges, and Contributions**: Usually found within the first few sections.
- **Solutions**: Typically located in the main body of the paper.
- **Experiment Results**: Usually appear toward the end in sections titled "Experiments" or "Empirical Studies."

The content is retrieved in annotated chunks, marked with **SECTION_X** (indicating the specific section)
or **POS_0.XX** (indicating the position within the paper, calculated as current page/total pages).
Use these annotations to identify and focus on the sections most relevant to the userâ€™s query,
ensuring a precise and targeted response.

 **SECTION_abstract**: ABSTRACT Motivated by recent advances in large language models for Natural Language Processing NLP , we design a time series foundation model for forecasting whose out of the box zero shot performance on a variety of public datasets comes close to the accuracy of state of the art supervised forecasting models for each individual dataset. Our model is based on pretraining a decoder style attention
**SECTION_abstract**: model with input patching, using a large time series corpus comprising both real world and synthetic datasets. Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets suggests that the model can yield accurate zero shot forecasts across different domains, forecasting horizons and temporal granularities.
