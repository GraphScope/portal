        "problem_definition": "The paper focuses on the challenge of forecasting financial time series, particularly in the context of multivariate time series forecasting. Financial time series are characterized by their high noise levels, non-linear trends, heavy tails, and limited historical data. The primary goal is to develop a model that can effectively capture and utilize the temporal relationships and correlations between multiple financial time series to improve forecasting accuracy.",
        "problem_value": "1. **Economic and Financial Importance**: Accurate forecasting of financial time series is crucial for various economic and financial applications, including investment strategies, risk management, and policy-making. Improved forecasting can lead to better decision-making and potentially higher returns or reduced risks. 2. **Challenges in Data**: Financial time series data are inherently noisy and often exhibit non-linear patterns, making them difficult to model with traditional methods. Addressing these challenges can lead to significant advancements in the field of financial econometrics and machine learning. 3. **Limited Historical Data**: Many financial time series are of limited duration, and long historical records may not always be available or relevant due to changes in the financial environment. Developing models that can work effectively with limited data is essential.",
        "existing_solutions": "1. **Traditional Autoregressive Models (e.g., VAR, ARMA)**: - **Linear Assumptions**: These models assume linear relationships in the data, which often fail to capture the complex, non-linear patterns present in financial time series. - **Limited Flexibility**: They are less flexible and may not perform well in capturing long-term dependencies or handling high noise levels. 2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**: - **Computational Complexity**: RNNs and LSTMs can be computationally expensive and require a large amount of data to train effectively. - **Vanishing Gradient Problem**: These models can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, making it difficult to capture long-term dependencies in the data. - **Data Requirements**: They often require long historical time series, which may not be available or relevant in rapidly changing financial markets."
