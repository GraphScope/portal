        "problem_definition": "The research paper focuses on the challenge of developing effective negotiation strategies for automated agents. Specifically, it addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma, large action spaces, partial observations, and complex acceptance functions.",
        "problem_value": "Negotiation is a fundamental process in many domains, including diplomacy, resource allocation, and trading. Effective negotiation strategies can significantly impact outcomes in these areas. The dynamic nature of negotiation environments necessitates adaptive and robust strategies. The ability to handle large action spaces and partial observations is crucial for scaling negotiation strategies to real-world applications. Addressing the exploration-exploitation dilemma and handling large action spaces can lead to both theoretical advancements in machine learning and practical improvements in automated negotiation systems.",
        "existing_solutions": "Many existing works on negotiation primarily focus on exploiting known strategies, often neglecting the need for exploration. Simple exploration methods like Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) techniques are used, which may not be sufficient for complex negotiation scenarios. Traditional reinforcement learning approaches are often limited to tasks with a few hundred discrete actions or low-dimensional continuous action spaces, making them unsuitable for combinatorial negotiation problems. Existing methods often assume full observability of the counterpart's preferences, which is rarely the case in real-world negotiations. Most existing works on combinatorial bandits rely on semi-bandit feedback, where the acceptance of individual items is known. Full bandit feedback, where only the aggregate acceptance value is available, is more challenging and less explored."
