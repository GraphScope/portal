**Question**: Please summarize some challenges in this paper. Each challenge has a summarized NAME, detailed DESCRIPTION, and SOLUTION.

Guidance:
Research papers typically contain key components, including the problem definition, challenges,
contributions, solutions, and experimental results. These components are generally organized as follows:
- **Problem Definition, Challenges, and Contributions**: Usually found within the first few sections.
- **Solutions**: Typically located in the main body of the paper.
- **Experiment Results**: Usually appear toward the end in sections titled "Experiments" or "Empirical Studies."

The content is retrieved in annotated chunks, marked with **SECTION_X** (indicating the specific section)
or **POS_0.XX** (indicating the position within the paper, calculated as current page/total pages).
Use these annotations to identify and focus on the sections most relevant to the userâ€™s query,
ensuring a precise and targeted response.

 **SECTION_abstract**: dilemma, and the combinatorial nature handles large action spaces. Building upon this formulation, we introduce NegUCB, a novel method that also handles common issues such as partial observations and complex reward functions in negotiation. NegUCB is contextual and tailored for full bandit feedback without constraints on the reward functions. Under mild assumptions, it ensures a sub linear regret upper bound. Experiments conducted on three negotiation tasks
**SECTION_abstract**: Abstract Learning effective negotiation strategies poses two key challenges: the exploration exploitation dilemma and dealing with large action spaces. However, there is an absence of learning based approaches that effectively address these challenges in negotiation. This paper introduces a comprehensive formulation to tackle various negotiation problems. Our approach leverages contextual combinatorial multi armed bandits, with the bandits resolving the exploration exploitation

**SECTION_abstract**: demonstrate the superiority of our approach.
