User Query: **Challenge**:
RESPONSE: {'data': [{'name': 'Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma', 'description': 'In negotiation scenarios, agents must balance between exploring new strategies to discover potentially better outcomes and exploiting known strategies that have already proven effective. This dilemma is particularly challenging due to the dynamic and often uncertain nature of negotiations.', 'solution': 'The paper proposes the Negotiation Upper Confidence Bound (NegUCB) algorithm, which is designed to handle the exploration-exploitation trade-off effectively. NegUCB uses a contextual approach and upper confidence bounds to guide the selection of negotiation strategies, ensuring that the agent can explore new options while also leveraging known successful strategies.'}, {'name': 'Large Action Spaces', 'description': 'Negotiation problems often involve a vast number of possible actions, making it computationally infeasible to evaluate every possible strategy. This complexity can lead to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance in learning algorithms.', 'solution': 'NegUCB addresses the issue of large action spaces by leveraging a combinatorial multi-armed bandit framework. This approach allows the algorithm to efficiently manage and explore the large action space by focusing on the most promising actions based on contextual information and historical data.'}, {'name': 'Partial Observations', 'description': "In many negotiation settings, agents do not have complete information about the environment or the other party's preferences. This partial observability can make it difficult to make informed decisions and optimize negotiation outcomes.", 'solution': 'NegUCB incorporates hidden states to handle partial observations. By modeling the negotiation process with hidden states, the algorithm can account for the uncertainty and incomplete information, leading to more robust and adaptive negotiation strategies.'}, {'name': 'Complex Reward Functions', 'description': 'The reward functions in negotiation scenarios can be highly complex and non-linear, making it challenging to optimize negotiation strategies. Traditional methods may struggle to capture the nuances of these reward functions, leading to suboptimal outcomes.', 'solution': 'NegUCB uses kernel regression to handle diverse acceptance functions and complex reward structures. Kernel regression allows the algorithm to model and adapt to the non-linear and complex nature of the reward functions, improving the overall performance of the negotiation strategies.'}, {'name': 'Theoretical Guarantees', 'description': 'Ensuring that the learning algorithm performs well theoretically is crucial for its practical application. Many existing methods lack strong theoretical guarantees, especially in the context of full bandit feedback.', 'solution': 'The paper provides a theoretical analysis of NegUCB, showing that under mild assumptions, the regret upper bound of the algorithm is sub-linear with respect to the number of negotiation steps and independent of the bid cardinality. This theoretical guarantee distinguishes NegUCB from existing works and provides a strong foundation for its practical use.'}]}

 **SECTION_abstract**: dilemma, and the combinatorial nature handles large action spaces. Building upon this formulation, we introduce NegUCB, a novel method that also handles common issues such as partial observations and complex reward functions in negotiation. NegUCB is contextual and tailored for full bandit feedback without constraints on the reward functions. Under mild assumptions, it ensures a sub linear regret upper bound. Experiments conducted on three negotiation tasks
**SECTION_abstract**: Abstract Learning effective negotiation strategies poses two key challenges: the exploration exploitation dilemma and dealing with large action spaces. However, there is an absence of learning based approaches that effectively address these challenges in negotiation. This paper introduces a comprehensive formulation to tackle various negotiation problems. Our approach leverages contextual combinatorial multi armed bandits, with the bandits resolving the exploration exploitation

**SECTION_abstract**: demonstrate the superiority of our approach.
