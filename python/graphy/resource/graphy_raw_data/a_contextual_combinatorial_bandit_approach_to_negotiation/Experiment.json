Evaluation Metrics: Regret, which measures the difference between the optimal reward and the reward obtained by the algorithm. Baselines: UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound), LinUCB (Linear Upper Confidence Bound), and Epsilon-Greedy.",
            "results": "NegUCB outperformed the baselines in terms of lower regret across different synthetic environments. The improvement was particularly significant in scenarios with high-dimensional action spaces and complex reward structures. Authors' Analysis: The superior performance of NegUCB is attributed to its ability to handle full bandit feedback and complex reward functions without constraints. The sublinear regret upper bound under mild assumptions further supports the robustness of the method. Implications: NegUCB's effectiveness in synthetic environments suggests its potential applicability to real-world negotiation tasks."

            "settings": "Datasets: Three real-world negotiation datasets, each representing different negotiation scenarios (e.g., resource allocation, price negotiation, and collaborative decision-making). Evaluation Metrics: Success rate, negotiation efficiency (time to reach an agreement), and fairness (equity in outcomes). Baselines: Traditional negotiation algorithms (e.g., Nash bargaining, Pareto optimization) and reinforcement learning-based methods (e.g., DQN, PPO).",
            "results": "NegUCB achieved higher success rates and better negotiation efficiency compared to traditional and RL-based baselines. The method also demonstrated a more equitable distribution of outcomes, indicating improved fairness. Authors' Analysis: The results highlight NegUCB's ability to balance exploration and exploitation effectively in real-world scenarios. The method's adaptability to different types of negotiation tasks and its robustness in handling partial observations and complex reward functions contribute to its success. Implications: NegUCB can be a valuable tool in various negotiation contexts, potentially improving outcomes in both automated and human-assisted negotiations."

            "results": "NegUCB maintained consistent performance across a range of parameter settings, showing robustness to variations. The method's performance was less sensitive to changes in exploration rate and reward function complexity compared to the baselines. Authors' Analysis: The sensitivity analysis confirms the method's stability and reliability in different conditions. The reduced sensitivity to parameter tuning makes NegUCB easier to implement and use in practical applications. Implications: NegUCB's robustness to parameter variations enhances its practical utility, making it suitable for deployment in diverse negotiation environments."
