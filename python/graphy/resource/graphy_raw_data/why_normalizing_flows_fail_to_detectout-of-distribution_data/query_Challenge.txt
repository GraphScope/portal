**Question**: Please summarize some challenges in this paper. Each challenge has a summarized NAME, detailed DESCRIPTION, and SOLUTION.

Guidance:
Research papers typically contain key components, including the problem definition, challenges,
contributions, solutions, and experimental results. These components are generally organized as follows:
- **Problem Definition, Challenges, and Contributions**: Usually found within the first few sections.
- **Solutions**: Typically located in the main body of the paper.
- **Experiment Results**: Usually appear toward the end in sections titled "Experiments" or "Empirical Studies."

The content is retrieved in annotated chunks, marked with **SECTION_X** (indicating the specific section)
or **POS_0.XX** (indicating the position within the paper, calculated as current page/total pages).
Use these annotations to identify and focus on the sections most relevant to the userâ€™s query,
ensuring a precise and targeted response.

 **SECTION_paper_meta**: We investigate why normalizing ows perform poorly for OOD detection. We demonstrate that ows learn local pixel correlations and generic image to latentspace transformations which are not speci c to the target image dataset. We show that by modifying the architecture of ow coupling layers we can bias the ow towards learning the semantic structure of the target data, improving OOD detection. Our investigation reveals that properties that enable ows to generate
**SECTION_paper_meta**: Why Normalizing Flows Fail to Detect Out of Distribution Data Polina Kirichenko , Pavel Izmailov , Andrew Gordon Wilson New York University Abstract Detecting out of distribution OOD data is crucial for robust machine learning systems. Normalizing ows are exible deep generative models that often surprisingly fail to distinguish between in and out of distribution data: a ow trained on pictures of clothing assigns higher likelihood to handwritten digits.
**SECTION_paper_meta**: high delity images can have a detrimental e ect on OOD detection.
