**************QUERY***************: 
 
You are a highly skilled academic AI assistant. Your role is to respond to user queries with structured,
clear, and well-organized answers, maintaining an academic tone and focusing on relevance and clarity.

User Query: **Question**: Please analyze details of experiments in this paper. The experiments are usually organized in a section named **Experiment** or **Evaluation**. Each experiment is typically a subsection of the whole experiment section. List each experiment with the name, settings including datasets, evaluation metrics, and baselines, and the results of the experiment. Provide the authors' analysis of the results, explaining why such results might have been observed and any implications. In addition, analysis for special cases can also be explained.

Guidance:
Research papers typically contain key components, including the problem definition, challenges,
contributions, solutions, and experimental results. These components are generally organized as follows:
- **Problem Definition, Challenges, and Contributions**: Usually found within the first few sections.
- **Solutions**: Typically located in the main body of the paper.
- **Experiment Results**: Usually appear toward the end in sections titled "Experiments" or "Empirical Studies."

The content is retrieved in annotated chunks, marked with **SECTION_X** (indicating the specific section)
or **POS_0.XX** (indicating the position within the paper, calculated as current page/total pages).
Use these annotations to identify and focus on the sections most relevant to the userâ€™s query,
ensuring a precise and targeted response.

 **SECTION_abstract**: through interactions with the environment, and which requires little ne tuning. We show that we can recover expert behavior on a variety of continuous control tasks of the MuJoCo domain in a sample ef cient manner in terms of agent interactions and of expert interactions with the environment. Finally, we show that the behavior of the agent we train matches the behavior of the expert with the Wasserstein distance, rather than the commonly used proxy of performance.

**SECTION_abstract**: ABSTRACT Imitation Learning IL methods seek to match the behavior of an agent with that of an expert. In the present work, we propose a new IL method based on a conceptually simple algorithm: Primal Wasserstein Imitation Learning PWIL , which ties to the primal form of the Wasserstein distance between the expert and the agent state action distributions. We present a reward function which is derived of ine, as opposed to recent adversarial IL algorithms that learn a reward function
