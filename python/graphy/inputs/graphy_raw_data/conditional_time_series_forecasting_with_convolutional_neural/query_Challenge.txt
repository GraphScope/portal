**Question**: Please summarize some challenges in this paper. Each challenge has a summarized NAME, detailed DESCRIPTION, and SOLUTION.

Guidance:
Research papers typically contain key components, including the problem definition, challenges,
contributions, solutions, and experimental results. These components are generally organized as follows:
- **Problem Definition, Challenges, and Contributions**: Usually found within the first few sections.
- **Solutions**: Typically located in the main body of the paper.
- **Experiment Results**: Usually appear toward the end in sections titled "Experiments" or "Empirical Studies."

The content is retrieved in annotated chunks, marked with **SECTION_X** (indicating the specific section)
or **POS_0.XX** (indicating the position within the paper, calculated as current page/total pages).
Use these annotations to identify and focus on the sections most relevant to the userâ€™s query,
ensuring a precise and targeted response.

 **SECTION_paper_meta**: Conditional time series forecasting with convolutional neural networks Anastasia Borovykh Sander Bohte Cornelis W. Oosterlee This version: September 18, 2018 Abstract We present a method for conditional time series forecasting based on an adaptation of the recent deep convolutional WaveNet architecture. The proposed network contains stacks of dilated convolutions that allow it to access a broad range of history when forecasting, a ReLU activation function and conditioning
**SECTION_paper_meta**: interest rate and several exchange rates and extensively compare it to the performance of the well known autoregressive model and a long short term memory network. We show that a convolutional network is well suited for regression type problems and is able to e ectively learn dependencies in and between the series without the need for long historical time series, is a time e cient and easy to implement alternative to recurrent type networks and tends to outperform linear and recurrent models.
**SECTION_paper_meta**: Keywords: Convolutional neural network, nancial time series, forecasting, deep learning, multivariate time series
**SECTION_paper_meta**: is performed by applying multiple convolutional lters in parallel to separate time series which allows for the fast processing of data and the exploitation of the correlation structure between the multivariate time series. We test and analyze the performance of the convolutional network both unconditionally as well as conditionally for nancial time series forecasting using the S P500, the volatility index, the CBOE
