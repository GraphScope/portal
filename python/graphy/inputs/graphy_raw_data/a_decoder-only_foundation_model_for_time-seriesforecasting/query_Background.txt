 **SECTION_paper_meta**: A DECODER ONLY FOUNDATION MODEL FOR TIME SERIES FORECASTING A PREPRINT Abhimanyu Das Weihao kong Rajat Sen Yichen Zhou Google Research abhidas, weihaokong, senrajat, yichenzhou google.com April 19, 2024
**SECTION_1**: popular approach for forecasting rich, multivariate, time series data, often outperforming classical statistical approaches such as ARIMA or GARCH BJ68 . In several forecasting competitions such as the M5 competition MSA22 and IARAI Traffic4cast contest KKN 21 deep network based solutions performed very well. At the same time, we are witnessing a rapid progress in the Natural Language Processing NLP domain on large
**SECTION_1**: 1 Introduction Time series data is ubiquitous in various domains such as retail, finance, manufacturing, healthcare and natural sciences. In many of these domains, one of the most important use cases of time series data is forecasting. Time series forecasting is critical to several scientific and industrial applications, like retail supply chain optimization, energy and traffic prediction, and weather forecasting. In recent times, Deep learning models SFGJ20, OCCB19 have emerged as a
**SECTION_1**: foundation models for downstream NLP tasks. Large language models LLMs are growing in popularity because they can be used to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way RWC 19 . They are trained on massive amounts of data, which allows them to learn the patterns of human language. This makes them very powerful tools that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks, often in a zero shot learning mode.
**SECTION_1**: for pretraining language models, vast amounts of time series data is not readily available. In spite of these issues, we provide evidence to answer the above question in the affirmative. Author names are listed in alphabetical order. arXiv:2310.10688v4 cs.CL 17 Apr 2024
**SECTION_abstract**: model with input patching, using a large time series corpus comprising both real world and synthetic datasets. Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets suggests that the model can yield accurate zero shot forecasts across different domains, forecasting horizons and temporal granularities.
**SECTION_1**: of no additional training burden and significantly reduced compute requirements. It is not immediately obvious that such a foundation model for time series forecasting is possible. Unlike in NLP, there is no well defined vocabulary or grammar for time series. Additionally, such a model would need to support forecasting with varying history lengths context , prediction lengths horizon and time granularities. Furthermore, unlike the huge volume of public text data
**SECTION_1**: can be efficiently pre trained on this time series corpus. Compared to the latest large language models, our time series foundation model is much smaller in both parameter size 200M parameters and pretraining data size O 100B timepoints ; yet we show that even at such scales, it is possible to pretrain a practical foundation model for forecasting whose zero shot performance comes close to the
**SECTION_1**: A decoder only foundation model for time series forecasting A PREPRINT In particular, we design TimesFM, a single foundation model for time series forecasting that, when applied to a variety of previously unseen forecasting datasets across different domains, obtains close to state of the art zero shot accuracy compared to the best supervised models trained individually for these datasets . Our model can work well across
**SECTION_1**: accuracy of fully supervised approaches on a diverse set of time series data. Our work also suggests that unlike recent work GFQW23 that recommends Large Language Models such as GPT 3 and LLama 2 as out of the box zero shot forecasters, foundation models trained from scratch exclusively on time series data can obtain much better zero shot performance at a tiny fraction of its costs.
**SECTION_1**: different forecasting history lengths, prediction lengths and time granularities at inference time. The key elements of our foundation model are twofold: 1 a large scale time series corpus built using both real world mostly time series data from web search queries1 and Wikipedia page visits2 and synthetic data, which meets the volume and diversity of data needed for training our foundation model, and 2 a decoder style attention architecture with input patching, that
**SECTION_1**: This motivates the question: Can large pretrained models trained on massive amounts of time series data learn temporal patterns that can be useful for time series forecasting on previously unseen datasets? In particular, can we design a time series foundation model that obtains good zero shot out of the box forecasting performance ? Such a pretrained time series foundation model, if possible, would bring significant benefits for downstream forecasting users in terms
**SECTION_abstract**: ABSTRACT Motivated by recent advances in large language models for Natural Language Processing NLP , we design a time series foundation model for forecasting whose out of the box zero shot performance on a variety of public datasets comes close to the accuracy of state of the art supervised forecasting models for each individual dataset. Our model is based on pretraining a decoder style attention
