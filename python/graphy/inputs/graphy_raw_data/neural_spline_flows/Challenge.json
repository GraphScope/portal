            "name": "Limited Flexibility",
            "description": "Traditional normalizing flows, such as those based on coupling or autoregressive transforms, often rely on simple and easily invertible elementwise transformations (e.g., affine or additive transformations). These transformations can limit the model's ability to capture complex and multi-modal distributions, thereby reducing the overall flexibility and expressiveness of the model.",
            "solution": "The authors introduced a fully differentiable module based on monotonic rational quadratic splines. This module enhances the flexibility of both coupling and autoregressive transforms while retaining analytic invertibility. By using more complex and flexible transformations, the model can better capture the intricacies of complex distributions."

        {
            "name": "Maintaining Analytical Invertibility",
            "description": "While increasing the flexibility of transformations is crucial, it is equally important to ensure that the transformations remain analytically invertible. Non-invertible transformations can lead to issues in density estimation and sampling, which are fundamental operations in normalizing flows.",
            "solution": "The proposed monotonic rational quadratic splines are designed to be inherently monotonic, ensuring that they are always invertible. This property allows the model to maintain analytical invertibility even with increased flexibility, thus preserving the key benefits of normalizing flows."

            "name": "Empirical Validation",
            "description": "Demonstrating the practical benefits of the proposed method requires rigorous empirical validation. The authors needed to show that neural spline flows outperform existing methods in various tasks, such as density estimation, variational inference, and generative modeling of images.",
            "solution": "The authors conducted extensive experiments to validate the performance of neural spline flows. They demonstrated significant improvements in density estimation, variational inference, and image generation compared to traditional methods. These empirical results provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

        {
            "name": "Integration into Existing Models",
            "description": "For the proposed module to be widely adopted, it must be easily integrable into existing normalizing flow architectures. The challenge lies in ensuring that the new module can seamlessly replace existing transformations without requiring major architectural changes.",
            "solution": "The authors designed the monotonic rational quadratic spline module to act as a drop-in replacement for the affine or additive transformations commonly found in coupling and autoregressive transforms. This design ensures that the module can be integrated into existing models with minimal modifications, making it accessible and practical for researchers and practitioners."

            "name": "Handling Multi-Modality",
            "description": "Many real-world datasets exhibit multi-modal distributions, which are challenging to model accurately. Traditional transformations may struggle to capture the multiple modes present in the data, leading to suboptimal performance.",
            "solution": "Monotonic rational quadratic splines naturally induce multi-modality when used to transform random variables. This property allows the model to better represent and capture the multi-modal nature of complex distributions, thereby improving the model's representational power and overall performance."
