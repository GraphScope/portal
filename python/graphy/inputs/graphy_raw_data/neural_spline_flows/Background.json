        "problem_definition": "The paper 'Neural Spline Flows' addresses the challenge of enhancing the flexibility and performance of normalizing flows, which are a class of generative models used for density estimation and sampling. Specifically, the authors focus on improving the invertible transformations used in normalizing flows, particularly those based on coupling and autoregressive transforms.",
        "problem_value": "1. **Flexibility and Expressiveness**: Existing normalizing flows, while powerful, often suffer from limitations in their flexibility and expressiveness. This is because the choice of the invertible transformation significantly affects the model's ability to capture complex distributions. Enhancing the flexibility of these transformations can lead to better performance in various applications, such as image and audio generation, where capturing intricate patterns is crucial.\n2. **Efficiency**: Many existing models, especially autoregressive flows, are computationally expensive to invert, which can be a bottleneck in both training and inference. Coupling flows, while faster, are often less flexible. Therefore, developing a transformation that is both flexible and efficient is of great importance.\n3. **Analytic Invertibility**: Some recent advances in normalizing flows have introduced more flexible transformations, but at the cost of losing analytic invertibility. This means that these models require numerical optimization to invert, which can be slow and less reliable. Maintaining analytic invertibility is crucial for ensuring that both density evaluation and sampling can be performed efficiently.",
        "existing_solutions": "1. **Limited Flexibility**: Traditional transformations used in normalizing flows, such as affine or additive transformations, are relatively simple and may not capture the complexity of real-world data distributions. This limitation can result in suboptimal performance in tasks requiring high expressiveness.\n2. **Computational Efficiency**: Autoregressive flows, while highly expressive, are D times slower to invert than to evaluate, where D is the dimensionality of the input. This computational overhead can be prohibitive, especially for high-dimensional data. On the other hand, coupling flows, while faster, are often less flexible.\n3. **Loss of Analytic Invertibility**: Some recent advancements in normalizing flows have introduced more flexible transformations, but these often lack an analytic inverse. This necessitates the use of numerical optimization methods for inversion, which can be computationally expensive and less reliable compared to analytic methods."
