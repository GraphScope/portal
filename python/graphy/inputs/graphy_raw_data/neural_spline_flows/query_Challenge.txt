**Question**: Please summarize some challenges in this paper. Each challenge has a summarized NAME, detailed DESCRIPTION, and SOLUTION.

Guidance:
Research papers typically contain key components, including the problem definition, challenges,
contributions, solutions, and experimental results. These components are generally organized as follows:
- **Problem Definition, Challenges, and Contributions**: Usually found within the first few sections.
- **Solutions**: Typically located in the main body of the paper.
- **Experiment Results**: Usually appear toward the end in sections titled "Experiments" or "Empirical Studies."

The content is retrieved in annotated chunks, marked with **SECTION_X** (indicating the specific section)
or **POS_0.XX** (indicating the position within the paper, calculated as current page/total pages).
Use these annotations to identify and focus on the sections most relevant to the userâ€™s query,
ensuring a precise and targeted response.

 **SECTION_abstract**: which enhances the exibility of both coupling and autoregressive transforms while retaining analytic invertibility. We demonstrate that neural spline ows improve density estimation, variational inference, and generative modeling of images.
**SECTION_abstract**: Abstract A normalizing ow models a complex probability density as an invertible transformation of a simple base density. Flows based on either coupling or autoregressive transforms both offer exact density evaluation and sampling, but rely on the parameterization of an easily invertible elementwise transformation, whose choice determines the exibility of these models. Building upon recent work, we propose a fully differentiable module based on monotonic rational quadratic splines,
