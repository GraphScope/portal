            "description": "In negotiation scenarios, agents must balance between exploring new strategies to discover potentially better outcomes and exploiting known strategies that have already proven effective. This dilemma is particularly challenging due to the dynamic and often uncertain nature of negotiations. The paper introduces the Negotiation Upper Confidence Bound (NegUCB) algorithm, which uses a contextual approach and upper confidence bounds to guide the selection of negotiation strategies, dynamically adjusting based on the evolving context."

            "name": "Large Action Spaces",
            "description": "Negotiation problems often involve a vast number of possible actions, making it computationally infeasible to evaluate every possible strategy. NegUCB leverages a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework to manage large action spaces efficiently, focusing on the most promising actions and using contextual information to guide action selection, thus reducing the computational burden."

            "name": "Partial Observations",
            "description": "In many negotiation settings, agents do not have complete information about the environment or the other party's preferences. NegUCB incorporates hidden states to handle partial observations, using Bayesian inference to update beliefs about the hidden states based on observed data, leading to more robust and adaptive negotiation strategies."

            "name": "Complex Reward Functions",
            "description": "The reward functions in negotiation scenarios can be highly complex and non-linear. NegUCB uses kernel regression to handle diverse acceptance functions and complex reward structures, allowing the algorithm to adapt to the non-linear and complex nature of the reward functions and improving the overall performance of the negotiation strategies."

            "name": "Theoretical Guarantees",
            "description": "Ensuring that the learning algorithm performs well theoretically is crucial for its practical application. The paper provides a theoretical analysis of NegUCB, showing that under mild assumptions, the regret upper bound of the algorithm is sub-linear with respect to the number of negotiation steps and independent of the bid cardinality, providing a strong foundation for its practical use."
