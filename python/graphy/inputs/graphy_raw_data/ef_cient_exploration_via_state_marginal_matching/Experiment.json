            "settings": "Datasets: Simulated environments (details not provided in the abstract, but likely include environments like grid worlds, continuous control tasks, etc.). Evaluation Metrics: Exploration Efficiency (measured by the speed at which the agent covers the state space), Adaptation Speed (how quickly the agent adapts to new tasks or changes in the environment). Baselines: Random Exploration (naive baseline where actions are chosen randomly), Intrinsic Reward Methods (techniques that use curiosity-driven rewards to encourage exploration), Policy Gradient Methods (traditional RL algorithms that optimize policies directly).",
            "results": "Agents trained with the SMM objective explored the state space more efficiently and adapted to new tasks faster compared to the baselines. The SMM objective effectively encourages the agent to visit states that are underrepresented in the current state distribution, leading to more thorough exploration. The uniform target distribution ensures that the agent does not get stuck in local optima and continues to explore the entire state space. The mathematical formulation of the SMM objective as a two-player, zero-sum game between a state density model and a policy helps in balancing exploration and exploitation."

Evaluation Metrics: Task Success Rate (percentage of times the agent successfully completes the task), Learning Curve (rate at which the agent improves its performance over time). Baselines: State-of-the-Art RL Algorithms (current best practices in RL for the specific tasks).",
            "results": "The SMM-based agents outperformed the baselines in terms of both task success rate and the speed of learning. The SMM objective's ability to efficiently explore the state space translates well to real-world tasks, where the complexity and variability of the environment require robust exploration strategies. The uniform target distribution helps in avoiding overfitting to specific parts of the state space, which is crucial in real-world applications where the environment is often non-stationary."

            "results": "When prior knowledge was incorporated into the target distribution, the agents showed significant improvements in performance, especially in tasks where the prior knowledge was highly relevant. The flexibility of the SMM framework allows for the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, which can significantly enhance the agent's performance. This experiment demonstrates the adaptability of the SMM approach to different types of environments and tasks, making it a versatile tool for reinforcement learning."
