        "problem_definition": "The paper focuses on the challenge of efficient exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) environments, particularly in scenarios where tasks have long horizons and limited or delayed reward signals. The central problem addressed is the development of a method to enable agents to explore environments effectively, especially in a task-agnostic manner.",
        "problem_value": "1. **Scalability and Efficiency**: Traditional exploration methods are often tailored to specific tasks, making them inefficient when applied to multiple tasks. A task-agnostic exploration policy can significantly reduce the computational and time costs associated with learning new tasks.\n2. **Generalization**: An exploration policy that works across multiple tasks can generalize better, leading to improved performance in unseen or new environments.\n3. **Real-World Applications**: Many real-world applications, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and complex simulations, require agents to operate in environments with sparse rewards and long-term goals. Efficient exploration is crucial for these applications to be practical and effective.",
        "existing_solutions": "1. **Lack of Explicit Objective**: Many existing exploration methods lack a clear and explicit objective. They often rely on implicit heuristics or auxiliary tasks, which can make it difficult to understand why these methods work and how to improve them.\n2. **Difficulty in Comparison**: The absence of a standardized metric to quantify exploration makes it challenging to compare different exploration methods and assess their effectiveness.\n3. **Single-Task Focus**: Most existing methods are designed for single-task settings, where the goal is to converge to the optimal policy for a specific task. This limits their applicability to multi-task scenarios, where the ability to explore efficiently across different tasks is essential.\n4. **Suboptimal Convergence**: Some methods, such as those based on predictive error, may not converge to an exploratory policy due to the omission of crucial steps like historical averaging."
