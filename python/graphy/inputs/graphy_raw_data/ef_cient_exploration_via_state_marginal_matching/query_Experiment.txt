**************QUERY***************: 
 
You are a highly skilled academic AI assistant. Your role is to respond to user queries with structured,
clear, and well-organized answers, maintaining an academic tone and focusing on relevance and clarity.

User Query: **Question**: Please analyze details of experiments in this paper. The experiments are usually organized in a section named **Experiment** or **Evaluation**. Each experiment is typically a subsection of the whole experiment section. List each experiment with the name, settings including datasets, evaluation metrics, and baselines, and the results of the experiment. Provide the authors' analysis of the results, explaining why such results might have been observed and any implications. In addition, analysis for special cases can also be explained.

Guidance:
Research papers typically contain key components, including the problem definition, challenges,
contributions, solutions, and experimental results. These components are generally organized as follows:
- **Problem Definition, Challenges, and Contributions**: Usually found within the first few sections.
- **Solutions**: Typically located in the main body of the paper.
- **Experiment Results**: Usually appear toward the end in sections titled "Experiments" or "Empirical Studies."

The content is retrieved in annotated chunks, marked with **SECTION_X** (indicating the specific section)
or **POS_0.XX** (indicating the position within the paper, calculated as current page/total pages).
Use these annotations to identify and focus on the sections most relevant to the userâ€™s query,
ensuring a precise and targeted response.

On both simulated and real world tasks, we demonstrate that agents that directly optimize the SMM objective explore faster and adapt more quickly to new tasks as compared to prior exploration methods. 1

**SECTION_abstract**: Abstract Exploration is critical to a reinforcement learning agent s performance in its given environment. Prior exploration methods are often based on using heuristic auxiliary predictions to guide policy behavior, lacking a mathematically grounded objective with clear properties. In contrast, we recast exploration as a problem of State Marginal Matching SMM , where we aim to learn a policy for which the state marginal distribution matches
**SECTION_abstract**: a given target state distribution. The target distribution is a uniform distribution in most cases, but can incorporate prior knowledge if available. In effect, SMM amortizes the cost of learning to explore in a given environment. The SMM objective can be viewed as a two player, zero sum game between a state density model and a parametric policy, an idea that we use to build an algorithm for optimizing the SMM objective. Using this formalism, we further demonstrate that prior
