            "settings": "Dataset: Synthetic market data used for pre-training and real-world e-market scenarios for testing. Environment: Simulated e-market environment where the agent engages in multiple concurrent bilateral negotiations. Baselines: Two existing well-known negotiation strategies: Concession-based Strategy, Tit-for-Tat Strategy.",
            "results": "The DRL-based agents achieved a higher negotiation success rate compared to both baseline strategies. The utility gain was significantly higher for the DRL agents, indicating better outcomes in terms of negotiation quality. The negotiation time was shorter for the DRL agents, suggesting more efficient negotiations. The DRL agents demonstrated better adaptability across different e-market settings, showing improved performance in dynamic environments."

            "results": "The DRL agents maintained a high negotiation success rate even in highly volatile market conditions. The utility gain remained consistently high, demonstrating the robustness of the DRL approach. The negotiation time increased slightly in more dynamic markets but was still lower than that of the baseline strategies. The DRL agents showed stable negotiation strategies, adapting effectively to changes in market dynamics."
