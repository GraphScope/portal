            "description": "One of the primary challenges in designing agents for concurrent bilateral negotiations is the dynamic and unknown nature of e-market settings. Traditional negotiation strategies often assume a static and predictable environment, which does not hold in real-world scenarios where market conditions can change rapidly and unpredictably.",
            "solution": "The authors propose a novel agent model that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to adapt to changing market conditions. Specifically, the agent employs an actor-critic architecture to learn negotiation strategies through interaction with the environment, allowing it to adjust its behavior based on new information and experiences."

            "name": "Concurrent Negotiations",
            "description": "Conducting multiple negotiations simultaneously is complex because the agent must manage multiple interactions and make decisions that consider the outcomes of all ongoing negotiations. This requires the agent to have a sophisticated understanding of how actions in one negotiation can affect others.",
            "solution": "The paper introduces a model that enables the agent to handle concurrent negotiations effectively. The agent's strategy is learned through extensive training in a simulated environment, which is extended from existing frameworks (e.g., Alrayes et al., 2016). This training helps the agent develop the ability to balance multiple negotiations and make optimal decisions in real-time."

            "name": "Initial Exploration Time",
            "description": "Reinforcement learning algorithms often require a significant amount of time to explore the environment and learn effective strategies. This initial exploration phase can be inefficient and may lead to suboptimal performance if the agent is deployed in a live setting before it has fully learned.",
            "solution": "To address this, the authors pre-train the agent using synthetic market data. This supervised pre-training reduces the exploration time required for the agent to learn effective negotiation strategies, thereby improving its performance from the outset. The pre-trained model serves as a starting point, allowing the agent to quickly adapt to real-world scenarios."

            "name": "Adaptability to Different E-Market Settings",
            "description": "E-markets can vary significantly in terms of rules, participant behaviors, and market dynamics. An effective negotiation agent must be able to adapt to these variations to perform well across different settings.",
            "solution": "The authors conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that their DRL-based agents can transfer their learned skills to a range of e-market settings. The experiments show that the agents outperform existing strategies, indicating that the model-free reinforcement learning approach is robust and adaptable to various environments."
