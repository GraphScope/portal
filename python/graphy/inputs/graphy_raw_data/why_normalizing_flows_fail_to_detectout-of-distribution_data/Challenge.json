            "name": "Local Pixel Bias",
            "description": "Normalizing flows tend to learn latent representations based on local pixel correlations rather than the semantic content of images. This bias makes it difficult for the model to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data, as it may assign high likelihoods to images that have similar local structures but different semantic meanings.",
            "solution": "Modifying the architecture of flow coupling layers can help bias the model towards learning the semantic structure of the target data. This adjustment can improve OOD detection capabilities by ensuring that the model focuses more on meaningful features rather than just local pixel patterns."

        {
            "name": "Likelihood Inflation",
            "description": "The paper identifies mechanisms through which normalizing flows can simultaneously increase the likelihood for all structured images, regardless of whether they are in-distribution or out-of-distribution. This phenomenon can lead to poor OOD detection, as the model may not effectively differentiate between in-distribution and OOD data.",
            "solution": "The authors suggest that by understanding and addressing these mechanisms, it may be possible to develop techniques to prevent likelihood inflation for OOD data. This could involve regularizing the model to avoid overfitting to structured patterns that are not specific to the training data."

        {
            "name": "Non-Specific Transformations",
            "description": "Normalizing flows learn generic image-to-latent space transformations that are not specific to the target image dataset. This lack of specificity can result in the model failing to capture the unique characteristics of the training data, leading to poor performance in OOD detection.",
            "solution": "By designing coupling layers that are more tailored to the target dataset, the model can learn transformations that are more specific to the training data. This approach can enhance the model's ability to recognize and reject OOD data."

        {
            "name": "Fidelity vs. Detection Trade-off",
            "description": "Properties that enable normalizing flows to generate high-fidelity images can have a detrimental effect on OOD detection. While these properties ensure that the generated images look realistic, they can also make the model less effective at distinguishing between in-distribution and OOD data.",
            "solution": "Balancing the trade-off between generating high-fidelity images and maintaining strong OOD detection capabilities is crucial. This can be achieved by incorporating additional constraints or loss terms during training that encourage the model to maintain a clear distinction between in-distribution and OOD data."
