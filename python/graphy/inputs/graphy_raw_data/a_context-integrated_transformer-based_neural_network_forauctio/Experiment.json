            "settings": "Dataset: Synthetic data generated to simulate single-item auctions with varying numbers of bidders. Evaluation Metrics: Expected revenue for the auctioneer, incentive compatibility, and individual rationality. Baselines: Traditional mechanisms like the second-price auction (Vickrey auction) and other neural network-based approaches.",
            "results": "CITransNet was able to recover the known optimal solutions for single-item auctions, achieving expected revenue that closely matched the theoretical optimum. The model maintained incentive compatibility and individual rationality, which are crucial properties for auction mechanisms."

            "settings": "Dataset: Synthetic data for multi-item auctions, including both symmetric and asymmetric scenarios. Evaluation Metrics: Expected revenue, efficiency (total value of items allocated), and fairness (equality of bidder utility). Baselines: Traditional mechanisms like the VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) auction and other neural network-based approaches.",
            "results": "CITransNet outperformed strong baselines in terms of expected revenue, particularly in asymmetric settings. The model demonstrated better efficiency and fairness compared to traditional mechanisms."

            "settings": "Dataset: New synthetic data not seen during training, including different numbers of bidders and items. Evaluation Metrics: Expected revenue, generalization error, and robustness to changes in auction parameters. Baselines: Same as previous experiments.",
            "results": "CITransNet showed strong generalization capabilities, performing well on unseen data and maintaining high expected revenue. The model's robustness to changes in auction parameters (e.g., number of bidders, item values) was notable."
