Computational Complexity: Many existing graph kernels and graph neural networks (GNNs) are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets. This limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. 2. Expressiveness vs. Generalization: While some methods are highly expressive in terms of differentiating non-isomorphic graphs, they may not generalize well to unseen data. Striking a balance between expressiveness and generalization is a significant challenge. 3. Scalability: Some methods, particularly those based on spectral structures, do not scale well to large graphs, making them impractical for big data applications. 4. Analytical Difficulty: The architecture of GNNs, which mixes representation and optimization, makes it difficult to rigorously analyze their power and limitations. This lack of theoretical understanding hinders further improvements and innovations. 5. Limited Benchmark Datasets: The performance of existing methods is often evaluated on a limited set of benchmark datasets, which may not be comprehensive enough to accurately assess their effectiveness.

They often struggle with high-dimensional datasets and can get stuck in local optima. 2. **Black Box Nature of Deep Learning**: While deep learning models can handle complex and high-dimensional data, they are difficult to interpret. This lack of interpretability limits their utility in scientific contexts where understanding the underlying mechanisms is essential. 3. **Generalization Challenges**: Deep learning models, particularly those trained on large datasets, may not generalize well to unseen data, especially when the data distribution changes.

For example, pre-training only on graph-level properties or node-level attributes does not fully capture the necessary information to perform well on downstream tasks. 2. **Domain Expertise Required**: Selecting appropriate pre-training tasks and data requires substantial domain expertise. Incorrect choices can result in poor performance or negative transfer, making it challenging to apply pre-training broadly. 3. **Inadequate Benchmark Datasets**: Existing downstream benchmark datasets are often too small to reliably evaluate the performance of pre-trained models.

For instance, in chemistry, predicting the properties of a new molecule often requires costly and time-intensive experiments. Pre-training GNNs on related tasks with abundant data can potentially mitigate this issue by leveraging transfer learning. 2. **Out-of-Distribution Generalization**: Real-world graph datasets often contain out-of-distribution samples, where the test graphs are structurally different from the training graphs. This is particularly relevant in fields like drug discovery, where the goal is to predict properties of newly synthesized molecules that are different from any previously seen molecules. Pre-training can help GNNs generalize better to these unseen distributions. 3. **Negative Transfer**: Naive pre-training strategies can sometimes lead to negative transfer, where the pre-trained model performs worse on the downstream task compared to a model trained from scratch.

As a result, traditional GNNs may produce suboptimal or even incorrect representations in heterophilic scenarios. 2. **Limited Receptive Field**: Conventional graph convolution operations aggregate information from a node's immediate neighbors, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This limitation can lead to poor performance in tasks that require understanding relationships between distant nodes. 3. **Inflexibility in Handling Different Relations**: Existing GNNs often treat all edges uniformly, without considering the different types of relationships that may exist between nodes.

Proving the universality of GNNs provides a strong theoretical foundation for their use in various tasks. 3. **Generalization to Varying Graph Sizes**: Unlike many previous works that consider a fixed number of nodes, this paper demonstrates that a GNN defined by a single set of parameters can approximate functions on graphs of varying sizes.
