GraphScope Portal is a user-friendly web interface that simplifies managing graph data with GraphScope. It offers one-stop access to data modeling, importing, querying, and monitoring, catering to both Interactive and Insight engines within the GraphScope Flex architecture.

## Core Features

### Data Modeling

Enables users to manually construct node and edge types, as well as quickly build models via YAML configuration files.

### Data Import

Supports uploading local CSV files, with dropdown field mapping selection. Also allows one-click data import through YAML configuration files.

### Interactive Querying

- Powerful Editor: Provides syntax completion and highlighting for Cypher and Gremlin, facilitating easy editing and modification by users.
- Multiple Query Methods: Allows users to write and save graph queries, browse query history, receive schema-based recommendations, and leverage natural language querying powered by OpenAI.
- Rich Visualization: Presents results in Graph or Table view modes, with user customization of node/edge colors, sizes, caption styles, and further data insights through "Switch Chart" functionality.

### Extensibility

- Plugin Integration: Supports incorporating "stored procedures" and "graph algorithms" as plugins for seamless use.
- Customization: Offers language switching, theme switching, and the ability to tailor theme colors and other details to individual preferences.

## Development

### Perpare

- install node.js : https://nodejs.org/en

Compile front-end assets

`npm run ci`

Initial deployment of the service:

`npm run deploy -- --proxy=http://x.x.x.x --port=8888`

explanation:

- `proxy` is the deployment address of the graphscope engine, defaulting to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
- `port` is the port of the service front-end, defaulting to `8888`.

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| studio-server   | Auto-generates Open API interfaces for Portal requests   |
| studio-importor | Data modeling and import module with visual capabilities |
| studio-query    | Data querying module supporting Cypher and Gremlin       |
| studio-site     | Main portal website                                      |
| studio-sdk-py   | WIP: Enables usage within JupyterLab                     |
