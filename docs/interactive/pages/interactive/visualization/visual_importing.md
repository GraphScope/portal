## Upload source data

Once the graph model is created, we can begin importing data.there are three ways to import data:

### Option 1: Manual Import

Each label contains a location field. Click the "upload" button to upload the corresponding CSV file to the interactive service.

Upon success, a location path will be returned, indicating the data has been imported.

### Option 2: Automatic Import After CSV Parsing

This Option extends the convenience of automatic CSV modeling. During CSV parsing, the system caches the source file locally in the browser. As a result, the data can be automatically uploaded on the data loading page.

### Option 3: Import via Configuration File

## Bind Data Source

After uploading the data, click the "data source binding" button to bind the data path to the model label. If successful, a configuration panel will appear.

Click "import" to proceed to the job page.

## Verify Results

At this point, validate the data on the query page. We will cover this in detail in the next chapter. Letâ€™s move on to the next chapter!
